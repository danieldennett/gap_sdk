This example shows how to capture PDM samples on 4 microphones using 2 interfaces and double-data rate (DDR).
It can be run on the board with command "make all run" or on gvsoc with command "make all gen run platform=gvsoc".
On gvsoc, the Makefile is generating wav files, which are given to the microphone model to generate the input I2S stream.
